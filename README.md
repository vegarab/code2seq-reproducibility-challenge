# Reproducibility Challenge: code2seq
Reproducibility challenge of the paper "code2seq: Generating Sequences from Structured Representations of Code" http://code2seq.org

Inspired by the reproducibility challenge encouraged by the International
Conference on Representation Learning, this study attempts to contribute to the
ongoing effort of addressing the lack of reproducibility of published results
in Machine Learning papers. This paper aims to review the publication
‘Code2Seq: Generating Sequences from Structured Representations of Code’ by
reimplementing it in a different framework, training it using the same datasets
and performing a qualitative comparison of the model. The reproduced results
successfully demonstrates an improvement over previous state-of-the-art
results, but fail to achieve the quoted performance in the original
publication.
